    "This project analyzes real-world data from a Minecraft research server run by UBC’s Computer Science department. The goal is to predict how long players stay in the game based on their age and experience, helping researchers target their recruitment efforts, and make sure they have enough resources. The analysis will involve data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. \n",

    "We will help the researchers know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts by trying to answer the following question.\n",
